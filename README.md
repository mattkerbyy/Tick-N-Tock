# 🎮 Tick N Tock - Classic Tic-Tac-Toe Game Reimagined

Welcome to **Tick N Tock!** A compact, nostalgic take on the classic Tic‑Tac‑Toe game built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Shadcn UI**, and **Framer Motion**.

## About

Tick N Tock is a compact web game project I built to sharpen my modern front-end skills while delivering a polished, responsive, and accessible experience. It’s implemented with Next.js, styled using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI, animated with Framer Motion, and enhanced by a lightweight WebAudio helper for in-browser sound effects. Additionally, it was an opportunity to learn new techniques for improving SEO, including optimizing metadata, structuring content, and ensuring clean, crawl-friendly code.
